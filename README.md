[contributions.tscircuit.com](https://contributions.tscircuit.com) ・ [tscircuit.com](https://tscircuit.com) ・ [Contribution Overviews](./contribution-overviews/) ・ [Changelogs](./changelogs/)

Generates weekly contribution overviews for tscircuit contributors. Check out all
the [contribution overviews here](./contribution-overviews/)
You can find AI-generated monthly changelogs in the [changelogs directory](./changelogs/).

- All PRs in the tscircuit org are scanned/summarized via an LLM
- The LLM classifies each Diff/PR as into a set of attributes for scoring
- All the PRs, summaries, and classifications are organized into charts and tables for [the website](https://contributions.tscircuit.com)

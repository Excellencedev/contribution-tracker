This meant disconnected endpoints in net-level traces were never detected. Solution (3 changes): 1. Removed the skip: Deleted if (!sourceTrace) continue so net-level traces are now checked 2. Handle undefined sourceTrace: Changed to const expectedPorts  sourceTrace ? pcbPorts.filter(...) :  and added ?. operators 3. Added floating endpoint check: For net-level traces (with no expectedPorts, check if both endpoints connect to ANY pad. If not, report the disconnected endpoint with coordinates. |

This meant disconnected endpoints in net-level traces were never detected. Solution (3 changes): 1. Removed the skip: Deleted if (!sourceTrace) continue so net-level traces are now checked 2. Handle undefined sourceTrace: Changed to const expectedPorts  sourceTrace ? pcbPorts.filter(...) :  and added ?. operators 3. Added floating endpoint check: For net-level traces (with no expectedPorts, check if both endpoints connect to ANY pad. If not, report the disconnected endpoint with coordinates. |

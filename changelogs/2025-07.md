- Autorouter now configurable from JSON: new `autorouter_configuration`, presets & trace-clearance settings ([circuit-json #236](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/236), [core #1029](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1029), [core #1033](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1033), [props #310](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/310), [props #311](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/311), [dsn-converter #108](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter/pull/108))
- Optional elbow routing for schematic traces ([core #1045](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1045))
- Major schematic auto-layout upgrade via new BPC Graph engine; net-label boxes skipped for cleaner results ([core #1047](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1047), [bpc-graph #35](https://github.com/tscircuit/bpc-graph/pull/35))
- Footprints: fixed incorrect 0603 dimensions & added custom pad sizes, plus new M2-host connector and SOT-25 footprints ([footprinter #316](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/316), [#319](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/319), [#311](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/311), [#318](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/318), [core #1038](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1038))
- `tsci build` only processes `.circuit.tsx` & `.board.tsx` when no args are given, leaving other files untouched ([cli #258](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/258), [#260](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/260))
- New PCB DRC to enforce minimum clearance between traces; deprecated `checkTraceSpacing` removed ([checks #55](https://github.com/tscircuit/checks/pull/55), [#57](https://github.com/tscircuit/checks/pull/57))
- 3D viewer now handles bad STL URLs gracefully and shows clearer tooltips ([3d-viewer #370](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/370), [#375](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/375))
- tscircuit.com UX improvements: PNG download for unsaved designs, faster landing page, revamped import dialog & fixed search overlay ([tscircuit.com #1405](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1405), [#1418](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1418), [#1408](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1408), [#1409](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1409))
- Runframe: fixes missing height on Three.js canvas for correct viewer sizing ([runframe #853](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/853))

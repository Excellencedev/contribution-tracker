- New autorouter configuration support inside pcb_group JSON & props, including presets and trace-clearance options ([circuit-json #236](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/236), [core #1029](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1029), [core #1033](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1033), [props #311](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/311), [props #310](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/310))
- Implemented pcb-only pin-labeling via new `pcbPinLabels` prop and matching Core logic ([props #318](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/318), [core #1058](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1058))

- Transistor & diode enhancements: alt pin labels, avalanche / laser / photodiode variants, connection props ([props #329](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/329), [props #326](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/326), [core #1077](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1077), [core #1071](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1071), [core #1066](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1066), [schematic-symbols #337](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pull/337))
- Footprinter: new footprints (0504, 1812, JST-SH, SOT25, M2Host) and 0603/2512 dimension fixes ([footprinter #328](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/328), [#330](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/330), [#322](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/322), [#318](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/318), [#311](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/311), [#331](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/331), [#316](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/316))
- 3D viewer now gracefully handles bad STL URLs and shows clearer error tool-tips ([3d-viewer #375](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/375), [#370](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/370))

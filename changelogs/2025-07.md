# Changelog 2025-07

- Added full schematic-table support across the stack â€” new element types, JSON schema, rendering and props ([circuit-json#237](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/237), [#238](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/238), [#239](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/239), [core#1059](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1059), [circuit-to-svg#278](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/278), [props#313](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/313))
- New `pcbPinLabels` prop to show pin labels only on PCB layouts ([props#318](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/318), [core#1058](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1058))
- `schematic_port.is_connected` flag now available in JSON and respected by core renderer ([circuit-json#235](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/235), [core#1060](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1060))
- Autorouter upgrades: preset option & configurable trace clearance, passed through to FreeRouting exporter ([props#311](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/311), [props#310](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/310), [core#1033](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1033), [dsn-converter#108](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter/pull/108))
- Footprint accuracy: fixed 0603 dimensions, plus new 1812 & 0504 sizes and corrected 2512 pads ([footprinter#316](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/316), [core#1038](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1038), [footprinter#330](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/330), [#328](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/328), [#331](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/331))
- Expanded symbol/component library: laser LED, photodiode, avalanche/zener/schottky diodes, alternative transistor pin labels & more ([core#1071](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1071), [core#1063-#1067](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pulls), [schematic-symbols#333-#321](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pulls), [#336](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pull/336))
- Schematic UX: optional elbow routing for traces ([core#1045](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1045)); improved autolayout via major BPC-Graph rewrite ([bpc-graph#65](https://github.com/tscircuit/bpc-graph/pull/65), [core#1047](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1047))
- CLI quality-of-life: `tsci build` now limits compilation to `.circuit.tsx` / `.board.tsx` files for faster builds ([cli#258](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/258), [#260](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/260))
- 3D viewer reliability: graceful handling of bad STL URLs with clearer error tool-tips ([3d-viewer#375](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/375), [#370](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/370))
- Website: new Datasheets section with searchable list, creation flow, redirects & AI descriptions ([tscircuit.com#1447-#1466](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pulls)); PNG download for unsaved circuits ([#1405](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1405)); faster landing page load ([#1418](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1418)); JSON and ZIP package downloads ([#1455](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1455), [#1392](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1392))

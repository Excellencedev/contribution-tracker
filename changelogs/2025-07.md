# Changelog 2025-07

- Introduced **Schematic Table** support end-to-end – new JSON element & cells, component props and SVG rendering ([circuit-json/#237](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/237), [#238](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/238), [#239](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/239), [props/#313](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/313), [#316](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/316), [circuit-to-svg/#278](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/278), [core/#1059](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1059))
- Added `is_connected` flag to schematic ports for easier wiring diagnostics ([circuit-json/#235](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/235), [core/#1060](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1060))
- Autorouter now accepts `traceClearance` and named `preset` configurations; UI passes settings through `pcb_group` ([props/#310](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/310), [#311](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/311), [core/#1029](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1029), [#1033](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1033))
- Core schematic editor gains **elbow routing** for cleaner 90° trace paths ([core/#1045](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1045))
- New `pcbPinLabels` prop allows showing pin labels only on PCB views, not schematics ([core/#1058](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1058))
- Added **flex / pack layouts & nested packing** for boards and sub-groups, incl. width/height & rotation controls ([props/#331](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/331), [#332](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/332), [#338](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/338), [core/#1088](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1088), [#1087](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1087), [#1095](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1095))
- Footprinter: fixed 0603 dimensions, added 0504, 1812 & 2512 footprints and bottom-layer pin-label silkscreen support ([footprinter/#316](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/316), [#328](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/328), [#330](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/330), [#331](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/331), [#332](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/332))
- `tsci build` CLI now restricts automatic builds to `.circuit.tsx` / `.board.tsx` files only ([cli/#258](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/258), [#260](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/260))
- 3D Viewer: robust handling of bad STL URLs and async rendering for traces ([3d-viewer/#370](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/370), [#372](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/372), [#375](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/375))
- Website gains ZIP/PNG download, datasheet pages & faster landing load ([tscircuit.com/#1405](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1405), [#1449](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1449), [#1450](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1450))

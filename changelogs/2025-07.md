# Changelog 2025-07

- Added full schematic-table support – new JSON elements ([circuit-json #237](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/237), [#238](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/238), [#239](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/239)), matching React props ([props #313](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/313), [#316](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/316)) and SVG rendering ([circuit-to-svg #278](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/278)).
- Richer autorouter configuration – new PCB-group fields ([circuit-json #236](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/236)), preset & trace-clearance options ([props #311](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/311), [#310](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/310)), Core support ([core #1033](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1033)) and export to DSN ([dsn-converter #108](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter/pull/108)).
- Footprint library improvements – fixed 0603 dimensions ([footprinter #316](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/316)), plus new M2HOST ([#311](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/311)) and SOT25 ([#318](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/318)) footprints (picked up in Core via [core #1038](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1038)).
- CLI change: `tsci build` now only compiles `.circuit.tsx` / `.board.tsx` files, never `index` files ([cli #260](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/260), [#258](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/258)).
- 3D-viewer shows clearer errors for bad STL URLs and better tooltip styling ([3d-viewer #375](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/375), [#370](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/370)).
- Core bug fixes: net-label anchors ([#1040](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1040)); pin-label-only chips ([#1041](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1041)); solder-jumper pin counts ([#1039](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1039)); match-adapt group offset ([#1031](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1031)); translated-group text placement ([#1025](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1025)); pin-header lookup inside groups ([#1028](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1028)).
- Website: download PNGs for unsaved circuits ([tscircuit.com #1405](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1405)) and faster landing page load ([#1418](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1418)).
- graphics-debug supports titled vertical stacks ([graphics-debug #69](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/69)).
- Generated SVGs now embed version metadata for easier debugging ([circuit-to-svg #279](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/279)).

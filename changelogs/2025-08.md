- Full pill-hole & square-pad plated-hole support across the tool-chain ([pcb-viewer #352](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/352) | [kicad-component-converter #124](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-component-converter/pull/124) | [dsn-converter #111](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter/pull/111) | [3d-viewer #426](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/426)).
- New “Match Pack” automatic schematic-layout engine enables one-click clean schematics ([core #1141](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1141)).
- Manual PCB trace routing via the new `pcbPath` prop ([core #1133](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1133); documented in [docs #110](https://github.com/tscircuit/docs/pull/110)).
- Option to show silkscreen pin labels on footprints ([core #1134](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1134) | [tscircuit#733](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit/pull/733)).
- Flex & grid layout improvements for schematic/PCB groups — works even without explicit board dims ([core #1158](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1158) | [core #1164](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1164) | [core #1168](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1168)).
- New voltage-source family: AC source and square-wave source with duty-cycle support ([core #1167](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1167) | [core #1212](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1212) | [circuit-json #255](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/255) | [circuit-json #258](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/258)).

# Changelog 2025-08

- Schematic-viewer now offers built-in SPICE simulation – quickly validate circuits without leaving the viewer ([tscircuit/schematic-viewer#102](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/102)).
- PCB-viewer gains a mobile-friendly ToolbarOverlay with touch support plus new on-hover ‘group overlay’ for inspecting grouped objects ([pcb-viewer#355](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/355), [pcb-viewer#354](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/354)).
- Added pill-/square-shaped plated-hole support across the stack: PCB-viewer, KiCad converter and Dsn converter – enabling import, display and DRC of non-circular holes ([pcb-viewer#352](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/352), [kicad-component-converter#124](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-component-converter/pull/124), [dsn-converter#111 & 112](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter/pull/111)).
- New Automatic Schematic Layout (“Match Pack”) for one-click neat schematics; respects orientation/rotation and overlapping groups fixes ([core#1141](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1141), [core#1145](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1145), [core#1153](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1153)).
- Manual PCB routing unlocked via `pcbPath` prop; full docs & autocompletion included ([core#1133](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1133), [props#354](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/354), [docs#110](https://github.com/tscircuit/docs/pull/110)).
- New grid & flex board layouts – auto-arrange groups with `minicssgrid` or flexbox even when board size unspecified ([core#1164](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1164), [core#1166](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1166), [core#1158](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1158), [core#1168](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1168)).
- Added AC VoltageSource component and full SPICE export support ([core#1167](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1167), [circuit-json-to-spice#9](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice/pull/9)).
- DRC improvements: check every PCB port is connected and warn on missing traces ([core#1157](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1157), [checks#67](https://github.com/tscircuit/checks/pull/67)).
- `internallyConnectedPins` can now be numeric, simplifying multi-pin component authoring ([core#1161](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1161), [props#357](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/357)).
- Silkscreen pin labels toggle (`showSilkscreenPinLabels`) for clearer board assembly ([core#1134](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1134), [tscircuit#733](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit/pull/733)).
- 3D-viewer migrated to vanilla three.js for lighter bundle & React-19 readiness; tooltip reliability fixes and experimental React-19 build ([3d-viewer#401](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/401), [#402](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/402), [#410](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/410)).
- Footprinter & KiCad pipeline now render KiCad plated holes correctly and improve parity testing ([footprinter#345](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/345), [#347](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/347)).
- RunFrame adds a File menu with download/export options plus loading skeletons for large files ([runframe#990](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/990), [#1013](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1013)).
- tscircuit.com: download GLTF models & 3D PNGs, PR-preview URLs, package search, faster file loading & collapsible sidebar ([tscircuit.com#1562](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1562), [#1578](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1578), [#1543](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1543), [#1612](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1612), [#1561](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1561)).

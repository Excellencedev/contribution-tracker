- Broader CAD-model support & scaling: GLB/STEP/WRL props ([props [#380](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/380)]), WRL serving ([kicad-mod-cache [#7](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-mod-cache/pull/7)]), WRL/GLTF loading + unit scaling in 3D viewer ([3d-viewer [#463](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/463)] & [#470](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/470)), core storage ([core [#1318](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1318)]) and scale handling ([#1325](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1325)).
- Hole-offset for pads: data ([circuit-json [#274](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/274)]), props API ([props [#392](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/392)]), core ([core [#1326](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1326)]), PCB viewer ([pcb-viewer [#371](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/371)]), SVG export ([circuit-to-svg [#310](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/310)]).
- Rounded board outlines now supported in layout/rendering ([core [#1327](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1327)] + props for border radius [props [#368](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/368)]).
- Pin-header PCB orientation prop respected in placement ([props [#381](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/381)], [core [#1311](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1311)]).
- Component margin props honored: schematic ([props [#386](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/386)], [core [#1314](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1314)]) and PCB ([props [#385](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/385)], [core [#1312](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1312)]).
- Pill-shaped SMT pads supported in Footprinter ([footprinter [#367](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/367)]).
- Power symbols revamped: VCC/GND replaced by rail symbol ([core [#1315](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1315)], [schematic-symbols [#360](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pull/360)]).
- SVG export can highlight all traces of a net ([circuit-to-svg [#303](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/303)]).
- External footprint load errors surfaced to users ([core [#1319](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1319)]).

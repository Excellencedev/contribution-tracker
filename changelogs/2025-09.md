# Changelog 2025-09

- Copper pour support added across the stack â€“ data model, SVG, PCB & 3D viewers ([circuit-json #265](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/265), [#267](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/267), [pcb-viewer #367](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/367), [3d-viewer #456](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/456), [circuit-to-svg #307](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/307), [circuit-json-to-gerber #53](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gerber/pull/53))
- End-to-end CAD model support for WRL/GLB/STEP formats ([circuit-json #268](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/268), [#270](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/270), [props #380](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/380), [kicad-mod-cache #7](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-mod-cache/pull/7), [3d-viewer #463](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/463))
- Schematic Viewer UX: persistent group view, mobile touch support, overlay & z-index fixes, version info in menu ([schematic-viewer #124](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/124), [#120](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/120), [#129](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/129), [#128](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/128), [#126](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/126))

- New schematic symbols: digital ground, resized VCC, renamed rail symbol ([schematic-symbols #361](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pull/361), [#362](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pull/362), [#360](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/pull/360))
- Board-level props: copper pour component, rounded board corners, pin-header orientation & position anchors ([props #371](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/371), [#368](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/368), [#381](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/381), [#383](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/383))

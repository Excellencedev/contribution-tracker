- New pad shapes: pill-shaped SMT pads ([core #1362](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1362), [pcb-viewer #378](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/378), [footprinter #367](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/pull/367)), pill plated-hole rotation ([core #1365](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1365), [pcb-viewer #379](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/379)).
- Added `rectBorderRadius` to rectangular pads ([core #1355](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1355)) with viewer support ([pcb-viewer #375](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/375), [circuit-to-svg #313](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/313)).
- Board-level upgrades: rounded board outlines ([core #1327](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1327)), board-pinout metadata & viewer overlay ([core #1364](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1364)).
- CAD model handling: GLB/WRL URLs in circuit data ([circuit-json #268](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/268)), WRL loading in 3D viewer ([3d-viewer #463](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/463)), correct MIME serving in mod cache ([kicad-mod-cache #7](https://github.com/tscircuit/kicad-mod-cache/pull/7)).
- PCB viewer UX: hover-to-highlight & error positions ([pcb-viewer #369](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/pull/369)), center orbit controls on board ([3d-viewer #480](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/480)).
- Autorouter now works with footprints fetched asynchronously ([core #1294](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1294)) and respects PCB component constraints ([core #1312](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1312)).
- Schematic enhancements: power-direction arrows on pins ([core #1284](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1284)), manual via traces ([core #1283](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1283)), same-net trace highlighting in SVG ([circuit-to-svg #303](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/303)).
- Schematic-viewer quality of life: mobile touch support ([schematic-viewer #120](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/120)), persistent group visibility ([schematic-viewer #124](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/124)), version info in menu ([schematic-viewer #126](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/126)), and overlay-loss fix while panning ([schematic-viewer #129](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/129)).
- CLI: added KiCad footprint search & filtering ([cli #336](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/336), [#338](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/pull/338)).

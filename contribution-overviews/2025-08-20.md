| [#1597](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1597) | 🐌 Tiny | imrishabh18 | Fixes the GitHub repository selector dropdown styling to ensure it matches the trigger width and stays aligned, while wrapping repository options in CommandList for consistent styling and behavior. |
| [#1595](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1595) | 🐌 Tiny | abimaelmartell | Switches the package_fileslist API to use GET with query parameters, updating client hooks and components accordingly, and adjusting registry utilities and tests to reflect this change. |
| [#1594](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1594) | 🐌 Tiny | abimaelmartell | Avoid unnecessary package_filesget call by listing release files first and load LICENSE file content only when present in release. |
| [#1592](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/pull/1592) | 🐌 Tiny | abimaelmartell | Changes the package_filesget endpoint to use GET with query parameters, updates client hooks and scripts accordingly, and aligns tests with the new GET behavior. |

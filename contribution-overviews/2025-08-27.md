| [#442](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/442) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Add GLTF export functionality to the viewer context menu, allowing users to download the 3D scene as a GLTF file. |
| [#1198](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1198) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Fixes net label rendering issue where labels are not drawn if theres a trace, ensuring labels are displayed when a source net or assigned display name is present. |
| [#83](https://github.com/tscircuit/jlcsearch/pull/83) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Add list and JSON routes for ARM-based microcontrollers, document ARM processor search, and test ARM processor endpoint. |

| [#29](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/29) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This pull request introduces a new feature that adds a center pad to components, which helps prevent them from overlapping with other components during the packing process. This is achieved by modifying the buildPackedComponent function to include an optional parameter shouldAddInnerObstacles, which, when set to true, creates an inner pad that represents the components bounds. This change is expected to improve the layout of components in the circuit design, ensuring better spacing and organization. |

| [#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-trace-solver/pull/17) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Orders single-line solver candidate paths by path length so shorter traces are tried first and tests that the solver selects the shortest available candidate path. |
| [#16](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-trace-solver/pull/16) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds a PasteInput page, updates calculate-elbow to fix floating point issues with near-axis aligned traces, and introduces download functionality for page.tsx and test.ts files. |
| [#13](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-trace-solver/pull/13) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Fixes MSP connection pair solver to return all pairs and adds logging for better debugging. |
| [#8](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-preview/pull/8) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Integrates Babel standalone into the project, allowing for the removal of Babel from the installation instructions. |
| [#110](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-viewer/pull/110) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Memoizes circuit-to-svg rendering on a stable circuit hash to prevent redundant calls during user interactions. |
| [#432](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/pull/432) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes the issue of duplicate canvas creation by ensuring existing canvases are removed before creating a new WebGL renderer. |
| [#1209](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1209) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds reproduction of the 555 timer component and fixes PCB packing to prevent components from being packed inside each other. |

| [#1194](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1194) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Removes duplicate layered netlabels from the schematic display, ensuring that only unique labels are rendered at each anchor position. |
| [#1192](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1192) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes missing net label placements in the MSP schematic trace routing, addressing a regression issue. |
| [#1189](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1189) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes regression in schematic trace routing that caused failures in rendering net labels for jumper connections. |

|------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#29](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/29) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | seveibar | This pull request introduces a new feature that adds a center pad to components, which helps prevent them from packing inside other components. This is achieved by modifying the buildPackedComponent function to include an optional parameter shouldAddInnerObstacles. If this parameter is set to true, an inner pad is created based on the components bounds, which is then added to the list of pads for that component. This change is expected to improve the layout and organization of components in the circuit design. |

|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [#1198](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1198) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Fixes net label rendering issue where labels are not drawn if theres a trace but no source net or assigned display name. |
| [#1194](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1194) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Removes duplicate netlabels from the schematic display to prevent rendering issues and improve clarity in schematic representations. |
| [#11](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-elbow/pull/11) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Fixes small floating point errors causing incorrect path construction in elbow calculations |
| [#29](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/29) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This pull request introduces a new feature that adds a center pad to components, which helps prevent them from packing inside other components. This is achieved by modifying the buildPackedComponent function to include an optional parameter shouldAddInnerObstacles. If this parameter is set to true, an inner pad is created based on the components bounds, which is then added to the list of pads for that component. This change is expected to improve the layout and organization of components in the circuit design. |

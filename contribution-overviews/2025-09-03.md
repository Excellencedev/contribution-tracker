|------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#30](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/30) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | seveibar | This pull request introduces a new packing strategy called minimum_closest_sum_squared_distance to the OutlineSegmentCandidatePointSolver and SingleComponentPackSolver classes. It implements a two-phase optimization approach to improve the packing of components by minimizing the distance to the closest target point after an initial optimization phase. The changes include modifications to existing classes and the addition of a new TwoPhaseIrlsSolver class to handle the new strategy. This enhancement aims to improve the overall efficiency and accuracy of the packing algorithm. |

| PRs # | Impact | Rating | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| [#1273](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1273) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Updates the matchpack dependency to version 0.0.12 and the calculate-packing dependency to version 0.0.31, optimizing symmetry handling in the packing algorithm. |
| [#18](https://github.com/tscircuit/math-utils/pull/18) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Add utilities to compute overlapping area and minimum distance between bounding rectangles, along with documentation updates. |
| [#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/math-utils/pull/17) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds a function to determine if two bounding rectangles overlap, along with corresponding tests. |
| [#73](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/73) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Sorts rectangles by area before rendering so smaller ones appear on top when overlapping, and adds utility and tests for sorting rectangles by area. |
| [#30](https://github.com/tscircuit/calculate-packing/pull/30) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | This pull request introduces a new packing strategy called minimum_closest_sum_squared_distance to the OutlineSegmentCandidatePointSolver and SingleComponentPackSolver classes. It implements a two-phase optimization approach to improve the packing of components by minimizing the distance to the closest target point after an initial optimization phase. The changes include modifications to existing classes and the addition of a new TwoPhaseIrlsSolver class to handle the new strategy. This enhancement aims to improve the overall efficiency and accuracy of the packing algorithm. |
| [#24](https://github.com/tscircuit/matchpack/pull/24) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds voltage source metadata to net definitions and modifies decoupling partition logic to require at least two decoupling capacitors connected to a positive voltage source and ground. |
| [#23](https://github.com/tscircuit/matchpack/pull/23) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Optimizes the packing algorithm to prioritize direct connections between pins, enhancing the efficiency of the packing process. |
| [#19](https://github.com/tscircuit/matchpack/pull/19) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds functionality to separate decoupling capacitors into their own partitions while partitioning remaining chips based on strong pin connections. |
| [#18](https://github.com/tscircuit/matchpack/pull/18) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adds a new solver to identify decoupling capacitor groups based on specific criteria, including pin configuration and connections to main chips. |
| [#17](https://github.com/tscircuit/matchpack/pull/17) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Switches the packing placement strategy to minimum_closest_sum_squared_distance for improved packing symmetry in circuit layouts. |
| [#16](https://github.com/tscircuit/matchpack/pull/16) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adjusts the packing algorithm to ensure that the chip body pad fully envelopes the pads, improving layout accuracy in inner partition packing. |
| [#261](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json/pull/261) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds a new SourceSimplePinout schema without a pin name list, includes it in unions and exports, and tests its parsing and union inclusion. |
| [#367](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/367) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Add SymbolProps and symbolProps for new symbol  container, export and document the symbol  schematic element, and add tests for symbol props parsing. |
| [#366](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/pull/366) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Add a pinout  component that reuses chip props, documents PinoutProps in README, exports new pinout schema, and adds basic parsing test. |
| [#1281](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1281) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes schematic trace configuration for better snapshot reliability and updates matchpack to new defaults. |
| [#1274](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1274) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds a new pinout  component backed by simple_pinout source type and updates dependencies. |
| [#1271](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1271) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Skip the rp2040 decoupling capacitors test and add a benchmark for the RP2040 decoupling capacitors, registering it on the benchmark page. |
| [#1268](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/1268) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Adds an example circuit for the RP2040 microcontroller featuring decoupling capacitors for improved stability and performance. |
| [#74](https://github.com/tscircuit/graphics-debug/pull/74) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | Fixes the dimension overlay to ensure the hotkey for dimensions remains active immediately without requiring mouse interaction. |

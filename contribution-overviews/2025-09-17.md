| [#1167](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1167) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | seveibar | Reads the existing main_component hash parameter when mounting RunFrameForCli, passes it to RunFrameWithApi, and updates the CLI frame to write the selected main component back to the URL hash via history.replaceState. |
| [#1170](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1170) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | devroy10 | fixes 1168  Summary Centers the file selector without absolute positioning and constrains its width with truncation so it no longer overlaps or hides the PCBSchematic3D tabs on narrow viewports.  Changes libcomponentsRunFrameWithApiRunFrameWithApi.tsx Replace absolute-centered wrapper with flex-centered wrapper so the selector participates in layout. libcomponentsRunFrameWithApifile-selector-combobox.tsx Add responsive max-width, ellipsis truncation, and keep natural width otherwise.  Rationale Absolute positioning caused the file selector to float above and obscure the tabs at small widths. Letting it flow in flex with truncation keeps all controls accessible.  Risks Extremely narrow widths may still feel tight. Tabs now remain tappable, but we may want a future responsive collapse as CircuitJsonPreview cuts off to the right on smaller screens. |

| [#326](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/326) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ShiboSoftwareDev | This PR introduces a new SVG generator, convertCircuitJsonToPinoutSvg, to create pinout diagrams from circuit-json. This feature is designed to produce clear, human-readable reference diagrams for physical board connections.  New Top-Level Converter: Adds convertCircuitJsonToPinoutSvg to the public API, which generates a complete SVG string.  Automatic Label Layout:  Ports marked with is_board_pinout: true are identified and labeled.  Labels are automatically grouped by the nearest board edge (top, bottom, left, right).  A layout algorithm organizes labels along each edge, using staggering and elbow connectors for leader lines to ensure clarity and avoid overlap.  Board Element Rendering: The diagram renders key physical features from the circuit-json, including:  pcb_board with complex outlines and cutouts.  pcb_smtpad (rect, circle, polygon, etc.).  pcb_plated_hole (circle, pill, etc.).  pcb_hole.  A representation of pcb_component footprints.  Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests with SVG snapshot validation have been added to cover various board shapes and pin configurations. |
| [#323](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/323) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐ | imrishabh18 | Adds support for generating SVG snapshots of schematic elements including lines, rectangles, arcs, and circles. |

| [#1170](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1170) | 🐙 Minor | ⭐⭐ | fixes 1168  Summary Centers the file selector without absolute positioning and constrains its width with truncation so it no longer overlaps or hides the PCBSchematic3D tabs on narrow viewports.  Changes libcomponentsRunFrameWithApiRunFrameWithApi.tsx Replace absolute-centered wrapper with flex-centered wrapper so the selector participates in layout. libcomponentsRunFrameWithApifile-selector-combobox.tsx Add responsive max-width, ellipsis truncation, and keep natural width otherwise.  Rationale Absolute positioning caused the file selector to float above and obscure the tabs at small widths. Letting it flow in flex with truncation keeps all controls accessible.  Risks Extremely narrow widths may still feel tight. Tabs now remain tappable, but we may want a future responsive collapse as CircuitJsonPreview cuts off to the right on smaller screens. |

|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#1188](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1188) | 🐌 Tiny | seveibar | Updates the tscircuiteval package to the latest patch release version 0.0.332 in the package.json file. |
| [#1185](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1185) | 🐌 Tiny | imrishabh18 | Prevents the enhanced file selector dropdown from listing files whose names start with test.tsx by centralizing file filtering logic to ignore these generated test files. |
| [#1184](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1184) | 🐌 Tiny | Ayushjhawar8 | https:github.comuser-attachmentsassets60e9c48b-4039-4162-85ea-a27d561ff8f4 |
| [#1169](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1169) | 🐌 Tiny | Ayushjhawar8 | When you type, it prioritizes files in your current directory at the top Files from other directories show below with their full paths Search clears automatically when you close the dropdown No more clutter from section titles since the breadcrumbs provide sufficient context |
| [#1170](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1170) | 🐌 Tiny | devroy10 | fixes 1168  Summary Centers the file selector without absolute positioning and constrains its width with truncation so it no longer overlaps or hides the PCBSchematic3D tabs on narrow viewports.  Changes libcomponentsRunFrameWithApiRunFrameWithApi.tsx Replace absolute-centered wrapper with flex-centered wrapper so the selector participates in layout. libcomponentsRunFrameWithApifile-selector-combobox.tsx Add responsive max-width, ellipsis truncation, and keep natural width otherwise.  Rationale Absolute positioning caused the file selector to float above and obscure the tabs at small widths. Letting it flow in flex with truncation keeps all controls accessible.  Screenshots Before: selector overlaps 3D tab and content. After: selector centered; tabs remain visible; long paths truncated with ellipsis.  Testing Manually verified at 3201440 px widths. Verified popover search and selection still work. No linter errors.  Risks Extremely narrow widths may still feel tight. Tabs now remain tappable, but we may want a future responsive collapse as CircuitJsonPreview cuts off to the right on smaller screens.  Follow-ups Discuss whether the CircuitJsonPreview should move into a kebab menu on xs widths to keep it fully selectable. |

### [tscircuit/circuit-to-svg](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg)

|------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [#326](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/326) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ShiboSoftwareDev | This PR introduces a new SVG generator, convertCircuitJsonToPinoutSvg, to create pinout diagrams from circuit-json. This feature is designed to produce clear, human-readable reference diagrams for physical board connections.  New Top-Level Converter: Adds convertCircuitJsonToPinoutSvg to the public API, which generates a complete SVG string.  Automatic Label Layout:  Ports marked with is_board_pinout: true are identified and labeled.  Labels are automatically grouped by the nearest board edge (top, bottom, left, right).  A layout algorithm organizes labels along each edge, using staggering and elbow connectors for leader lines to ensure clarity and avoid overlap.  Board Element Rendering: The diagram renders key physical features from the circuit-json, including:  pcb_board with complex outlines and cutouts.  pcb_smtpad (rect, circle, polygon, etc.).  pcb_plated_hole (circle, pill, etc.).  pcb_hole.  A representation of pcb_component footprints.  Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests with SVG snapshot validation have been added to cover various board shapes and pin configurations. |

| [#326](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/pull/326) | 🐳 Major | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This PR introduces a new SVG generator, convertCircuitJsonToPinoutSvg, to create pinout diagrams from circuit-json. This feature is designed to produce clear, human-readable reference diagrams for physical board connections.  New Top-Level Converter: Adds convertCircuitJsonToPinoutSvg to the public API, which generates a complete SVG string.  Automatic Label Layout:  Ports marked with is_board_pinout: true are identified and labeled.  Labels are automatically grouped by the nearest board edge (top, bottom, left, right).  A layout algorithm organizes labels along each edge, using staggering and elbow connectors for leader lines to ensure clarity and avoid overlap.  Board Element Rendering: The diagram renders key physical features from the circuit-json, including:  pcb_board with complex outlines and cutouts.  pcb_smtpad (rect, circle, polygon, etc.).  pcb_plated_hole (circle, pill, etc.).  pcb_hole.  A representation of pcb_component footprints.  Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests with SVG snapshot validation have been added to cover various board shapes and pin configurations. |

| [#1170](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/pull/1170) | 🐌 Tiny | fixes 1168  Summary Centers the file selector without absolute positioning and constrains its width with truncation so it no longer overlaps or hides the PCBSchematic3D tabs on narrow viewports.  Changes libcomponentsRunFrameWithApiRunFrameWithApi.tsx Replace absolute-centered wrapper with flex-centered wrapper so the selector participates in layout. libcomponentsRunFrameWithApifile-selector-combobox.tsx Add responsive max-width, ellipsis truncation, and keep natural width otherwise.  Rationale Absolute positioning caused the file selector to float above and obscure the tabs at small widths. Letting it flow in flex with truncation keeps all controls accessible.  Screenshots Before: selector overlaps 3D tab and content. After: selector centered; tabs remain visible; long paths truncated with ellipsis.  Testing Manually verified at 3201440 px widths. Verified popover search and selection still work. No linter errors.  Risks Extremely narrow widths may still feel tight. Tabs now remain tappable, but we may want a future responsive collapse as CircuitJsonPreview cuts off to the right on smaller screens.  Follow-ups Discuss whether the CircuitJsonPreview should move into a kebab menu on xs widths to keep it fully selectable. |
